                A* accelerator provides an internship-like experience while teaching industry-level skills in computer science, allowing students to explore and accelerate their career opportunities.

                A* is a search algorithm that uses a predicted heuristic value based on certain parameters to find the shortest distance from the current state to a goal state. A* accelerator is a replica of the A* search algorithm where we utilize our resources and experiences to find the best possible path for our students to accelerate and explore their career, thus reaching their goal state.
